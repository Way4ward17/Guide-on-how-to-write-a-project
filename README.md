# Guide-on-how-to-write-a-project
This is a guide on how to write a computer science final year project. I developed this mostly for the student of AAUA (Nigeria). I believe it would be useful for other student from another universities. Most of the works uploaded here are done by me or collaborated with me. This repository will guide you throughout the whole chapters basically from 1 to 5.
