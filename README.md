# Guide-on-how-to-write-a-project
This is a guide on how to write a computer science final year project. I developed this mostly for the student of AAUA (Nigeria). I believe it would be useful for other student from another universities. Most of the works uploaded here are done by me or collaborated with me. This repository will guide you throughout the whole chapters basically from 1 to 5.

<p><strong>How to write your CHAPTER ONE</strong></p>
<p>First of all, before embarking of a journey of writing your project. There are some certain things you need to consider.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand your work properly</strong>: This include knowing why you want to work on that topic and its important. Your my not really know how it would be done but you need to know what will be used to do it. For example. Developing and android app to pay money online. We all know it involves programming. You might not be so good in programming to develop the work but you should know the language to be used in written it and the IDE to be used.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure what you understand about your work correlates with what your supervisor know you want to do: </strong>This is super straight forward. Don&rsquo;t intend to do A and your supervisor thinks you are doing B. Don&rsquo;t be scared to reach your supervisor, listen to what he or she wants to say. If its different from what you want to do.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Sir, I am sorry, I understand all what you just said, but its different from what I intend to do.</em></strong></p>
<p>Then you explain, so you both can be on the same level</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>When stock, immediately reach out for help:</strong> I am here for you. And Google or YouTube are there for you.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t always thing you must be right at first: </strong>That&rsquo;s the more reason we have a supervisor, to guide us. If something looks so confusing. Always meet him/her to explain better and the little you have done,(Don&rsquo;t let it to be too small) take it forward. You might think its wrong. Meanwhile is super correct. (I have many cases like that, where I was stuck in a colleague work. I just had to do something. And it came out to be the best the lecturer has seen so far). No body is the island of knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Everything you need is on the internet:</strong> keep researching and searching. You will see what you need.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid plagiarism: </strong>Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement. Plagiarism is the "wrongful appropriation" and "stealing and publication" of another author's "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions" and the representation of them as one's own original work.</li>
</ol>
<p>When-ever you copy any part of a sentence in any downloaded existing work, ensure u reference it and cite it. Citation is an inline reference like (way4ward,2020), which means way4ward is the author and he published it this year and references is that long one, usually at the last page of the work. And if where you got the information is a website or blog, write the name of the author and the year for citation and for referencing, write the name of the blogger and the year he posted it and title of the post and the url to the blog for referencing.</p>
<p>You would get to understand it more as we process further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT SECTION IN </strong></p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can sometimes leave this blank and start from the background of study. If you don&rsquo;t want to leave it black. Briefly define the basic thing your work entails and what you intent to do. Its similar to a summary. But I would advice you LEAVE IT BLANK</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The work begins here. Here, you divide your work into sections. Start by defining the main concept or the main concentration about your work in a minimum of two paragraph. Lets say for instance you are using machine learning to predict malaria. The main concentration is malaria, define malaria, causes of malaria, effect of malaria. Because your work is to predict malaria which is like a solution to reduce malaria. Then you start by talking about all the method used to treat or reduce malaria, you can talk about diagnosis and you talk about machine learning. After which u define machine learning and what is been used for then you say aw you will use it for your own work, so brief. With this your background of study would have covered 4 to 5 pages. Some supervisors like stories. Ensure you have talk about the main concept. And stories can be fit into the middle. The point where one will be talking about the effect of malaria. Just give numerous effects and causes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MOTIVATION OF STUDY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to statement of problem. Some supervisor don&rsquo;t want it. Originally. DON&rsquo;T USE IT. USE ONLY STATEMENT OF PROBLEM. Else you look for more than 2 statement of problem. Put some in motivation and 1 in statement of problem. Fine tune it with different English.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You will have only 1 aim and different objectives. Check the sample folder to see how it is been written.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the approach you want to use to solve the problem, probably the model (SDLC) if you will be doing design and implementation or you are developing something. Or the steps you will take to achieve the aim of the work if you are doing ML and others, you can as well show it in a diagram. Check the samples for this also.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what your work covers. Lets say you work is about lecturer or school. And you are not considering non-teaching staff or for school, you are not considering state university. You will state it here. IT IS NOT A COMPULSORY SECTION as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>THIS IS NOT A COMPULSORY SECTION AS WELL. If you want to add it. This is where you write what your work cant do. Its slightly similar to the inverse of scope of study.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DEFINATION OF TERM</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SOMETHING YOU CAN HAVE A SECTION CALLED</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROPOSED MODEL</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCEPTUAL MODEL</strong></p>
<p>This is similar to methodology. It&rsquo;s a diagrammatical expression of your whole work. Sometimes you might be so lucky to see what you need exactly on Google else you draw off-hand.</p>
<p><strong>1.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATHEMATICAL MODEL</strong></p>
<p>This is mostly useful in Machine Learning topics. So here you would write the mathematical expression of the algorithm you want to use. Just search on Google. You would see something useful.</p>
